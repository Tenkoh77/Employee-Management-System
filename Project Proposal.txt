Employee Management System â€“ Project Proposal & Design Overview

1. Project Summary
The Employee Management System (EMS) is a full-stack web application designed to streamline HR operations, including employee records, leave management, performance tracking, notifications, and reporting. It is built with a modern React/Next.js frontend, a Node.js/Express backend, and a Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) database.

2. System Architecture
2.1 High-Level Diagram
  A[Frontend (Next.js/React)] -- REST API --> B[Backend (Node.js/Express)]
  B -- mssql driver --> C[MSSQL Database]
  B -- Email/Notifications --> D[Email Service]
  B -- Scheduled Jobs --> E[Task Scheduler]

3. Backend Design
3.1 Technology Stack
- Node.js with Express for RESTful API
- MSSQL (Microsoft SQL Server) as the database
- JWT for authentication
- Joi for validation
- Nodemailer for email notifications
- node-cron for scheduled tasks

3.2 API Structure

- Authentication: /api/auth
- Login, JWT issuance, user session management
- Employees: /api/employees
- CRUD operations, search, filtering, role/department assignment
- Leave Management: /api/leave
- Apply, approve, reject, view leave applications, leave balances
- Performance: /api/performance
- Performance reviews, work logs, analytics
- Reports: /api/reports
- Generate and download reports, analytics dashboards
- Notifications: /api/notifications
- In-app and email notifications

3.3 Middleware

- Authentication: Validates JWT, checks user status
- Authorization: Role/permission-based access control
- Validation: Joi schemas for request validation
- Error Handling: Centralized error handler for API responses

3.4 Database Layer

- Connection: Managed via a singleton class using the mssql package
- Querying: Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Graceful Shutdown: Closes DB connections on process exit

4. Database Design
 4.1 Core Tables

- Employees: Personal, contact, employment, and authentication info
- Departments: Department metadata and manager assignment
- Roles: Role names, descriptions, and permissions (JSON)
- LeaveTypes: Types of leave (annual, sick, etc.)
- LeaveApplications: Leave requests, status, approval workflow
- LeaveBalances: Tracks leave allocation and usage per employee/year
- Projects: Project metadata for work logs
- WorkLogs: Daily work entries for employees
- PerformanceReviews: Review records, ratings, feedback
- PerformanceMetrics: Detailed metrics per review
- Notifications: In-app and email notification records
- AuditLogs: Tracks changes/actions for compliance

4.2 Relationships

- Employees belong to Departments and Roles
- LeaveApplications reference Employees and LeaveTypes
- PerformanceReviews reference Employees and Reviewers
- WorkLogs reference Employees and Projects

5. Frontend Design
 5.1 Technology Stack

- Next.js (React 19) for SSR and SPA features
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Radix UI for accessible UI primitives

5.2 Main UI Components

- EmployeeManagement: List, search, add, edit, and view employees
- LeaveManagement: Apply for leave, view balances, approve/reject requests
- PerformanceTracking: Submit/view reviews, work logs, analytics
- ReportsSection: Generate/download reports, view analytics dashboards
- NotificationsPanel: View in-app notifications, mark as read
- ThemeProvider: Light/dark mode support

5.3 User Experience

- Responsive, modern UI
- Dialogs for CRUD operations
- Tables with filtering, sorting, and pagination
- Real-time notifications and feedback

6. Reporting & Analytics

- Backend: Aggregates data for reports (performance, leave, work hours, department stats)
- Frontend: Visualizes analytics with charts, tables, and quick stats
- Downloadable Reports: PDF/Excel generation via backend utilities

7. Notifications & Scheduling

- NotificationService: Handles in-app and email notifications for events (leave, reviews, reminders)
- TaskScheduler: Uses node-cron for:
  - Daily leave reminders
  - Monthly leave balance updates
  - Weekly notification cleanup

8. Security

- Authentication: JWT-based, with token expiry
- Authorization: Role and permission checks on all sensitive endpoints
- Validation: All inputs validated with Joi
- Error Handling: Centralized, with user-friendly messages and stack traces in development

9. Extensibility

- Modular API routes and middleware
- Component-based frontend for easy feature addition
- Configurable roles/permissions via database

10. Deployment & Operations

- Environment Variables: .env for secrets and DB config
- Scripts: For setup, seeding, and testing DB connection
- Production Readiness: Secure headers, rate limiting, connection pooling

11. Sample Stories of what the system does for each user

- As an HR manager, I can add new employees and assign them to departments and roles.
- As an employee, I can apply for leave and track my leave balance.
- As a manager, I can review my team's performance and approve leave requests.
- As an admin, I can generate reports on employee performance, leave usage, and work hours.
- As any user, I receive notifications for important events and reminders.


12. Future Enhancements

- Self-service employee portal
- Mobile app integration
- Advanced analytics and dashboards
- Integration with payroll and external HR systems
- SSO and multi-factor authentication
